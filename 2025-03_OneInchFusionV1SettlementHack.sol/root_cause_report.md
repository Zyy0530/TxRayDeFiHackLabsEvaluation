# 1inch-Style Settlement Tx 0x6273...090d6 — No ACT Opportunity

## Metadata
- Protocol: 1inch-style limit order settlement / custom router flow (Ethereum mainnet)
- ACT classification (`is_act`): False
- Root cause category: other
- Adversary model assumptions: Standard ACT adversary model only: unprivileged EOA(s) and contracts they deploy, using public chain data and public tx/orderflow, with no access to privileged whitelists, admin-only functions, or private keys such as the hardcoded tx.origin/msg.sender 0xa7264a43a57ca17012148c46adbc15a5f951766e or 1inch resolver/settlement operator roles.

## ACT Opportunity & Predicate
- Block height B: 21982111
- Pre-state c sigma_B definition:

  Ethereum mainnet state immediately before block 21982111, including USDC (FiatTokenV2_2 at 0xA0b86991C6218B36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606EB48) totalSupply and key holder balances as reconstructed from the USDC state-diff and seed transaction metadata.

  - artifacts/root_cause/data_collector/iter_3/tx/1/0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6/usdc_state_and_balance_diff.json

### Transaction Sequence B
- Index 1 on chain 1: tx 0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6 (victim-observed)
  - Inclusion feasibility: This is a standard EIP-1559 transaction from EOA 0xa7264a43a57ca17012148c46adbc15a5f951766e to contract 0x019bfc71d43c3492926d4a9a6c781f36706970c9 with zero ETH value and sufficient gas; any unprivileged user can submit a comparable transaction, but this specific call path is restricted by contract logic to the hardcoded sender 0xa7264a43..., so an adversary without that key cannot replay or parameterize it directly.
  - Notes: Single observed seed tx that routes a settle(bytes orders) call via a custom router 0x019bfc71... into 1inch Settlement 0xA88800CD213dA5Ae406ce248380802BD53b47647, using resolver/solver 0xB02F39e382c90160Eb816DE5e0E428ac771d77B5 and touching USDC/USDT/WETH; there is no evidence of an additional attacker-crafted transaction in the same sequence.

### Exploit Predicate
- Type: profit
- Profit predicate (reference asset: USD)
  - adversary_address: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  - fees_paid_in_reference_asset: unknown
  - value_before_in_reference_asset: unknown
  - value_after_in_reference_asset: unknown
  - value_delta_in_reference_asset: 0

- Valuation notes:

  Across the seed tx, several addresses experience deterministic balance changes: (i) EOA 0xa7264a43... loses approximately 2.301072999e15 wei of ETH and has no USDC delta; (ii) address 0x4838b106fce9647bdf1e7877bf73ce8b0bad5f97 gains 1.867327295e15 wei of ETH as the miner/builder fee recipient; (iii) resolver/solver 0xB02F39e382c90160Eb816DE5e0E428ac771d77B5 loses exactly 2,000,000,000,000 units of USDC (2,000,000 USDC) and has no ETH delta; (iv) Settlement 0xA88800CD213dA5Ae406ce248380802BD53b47647 gains 999,999,999,985 units of USDC; (v) router/entrypoint 0x019bfc71d43c3492926d4a9a6c781f36706970c9 gains 15 units of USDC; (vi) EOA 0xBbb587E59251D219a7a05Ce989ec1969C01522C0 gains exactly 1,000,000,000,000 units of USDC (1,000,000 USDC). The reconciled USDC state diff shows totalSupply unchanged and the sum of all holder deltas equal to zero, so there is no mint/burn or accounting bug. We do see positive per-tx P/L for 0x4838... (ETH) and for 0xA888..., 0x019b..., and 0xBbb587... (USDC), but (a) 0x4838... is the fee recipient, not an attacker-controlled account; (b) 0xA888... is the verified 1inch Settlement contract with fee-bank semantics; (c) 0x019b... is a router whose decompiled code hardcodes msg.sender/tx.origin to 0xa7264a43..., so it functions as a user-specific smart account; and (d) 0xBbb587... is simply a designated USDC recipient and never sends the seed tx. There is no evidence that any adversary-related cluster, as defined in the ACT model, realizes a net positive portfolio change after accounting for gas and token flows; all observed value movements are consistent with expected builder rewards, 1inch settlement fees, and user order settlement. Therefore value_delta_in_reference_asset for any adversary cluster is effectively zero.

## Incident Overview & TL;DR

The examined Ethereum mainnet transaction 0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6 is a complex 1inch-style limit-order settlement routed through a custom router contract 0x019bfc71... that is hardcoded to the EOA 0xa7264a43..., which then calls the verified Settlement contract 0xA88800CD213dA5Ae406ce248380802BD53b47647 using resolver 0xB02F39e382c90160Eb816DE5e0E428ac771d77B5 to move USDC, USDT, and WETH between aggregator and user addresses. Reconciled ETH and USDC balance/state diffs show no token minting or conservation violation, and value movements (gas paid by the sender, fees to the miner, USDC debits from the resolver, and USDC credits to Settlement, the router, and beneficiary 0xBbb587...) are fully consistent with expected protocol and solver behavior rather than an exploit.

**Root cause TL;DR**

There is no protocol bug, MEV exploit, or misconfigured settlement logic in this flow; instead, it represents normal 1inch-style settlement where a whitelisted resolver spends its own USDC to fulfill user orders, pays protocol fees into Settlement’s fee bank, and transfers the desired amount of USDC to the designated recipient. Accordingly, this transaction does not constitute an ACT exploitation nor reveal an ACT opportunity.

## Key Background

- Preliminary context:
  - Settlement contract 0xA88800CD213dA5Ae406ce248380802BD53b47647 (artifacts/root_cause/data_collector/iter_1/contract/1/0xa88800cd213da5ae406ce248380802bd53b47647/source/src/Settlement.sol) is a verified 1inch-style contract that settles limit orders via IOrderMixin, enforces a resolver whitelist through OrderLib.Order.checkResolver, charges protocol/fee-bank fees via FeeBankCharger, and appends a structured suffix to limit-order interactions before calling IOrderMixin.fillOrderTo.
  - The router/entrypoint contract 0x019bfc71d43c3492926d4a9a6c781f36706970c9 (artifacts/root_cause/data_collector/iter_3/contract/1/0x019bfc71d43c3492926d4a9a6c781f36706970c9/decompile/0x019bfc71d43c3492926d4a9a6c781f36706970c9-decompiled.sol) exposes a settle(bytes orders)-style function (selector 0xd0322fbf) and an EIP-1271-like signature function (selector 0x1626ba7e), both of which are gated so that tx.origin or msg.sender must equal the single EOA 0xa7264a43a57ca17012148c46adbc15a5f951766e; this router therefore behaves as a user-specific smart account rather than a permissionless public interface.
  - The resolver/aggregator contract 0xB02F39e382c90160Eb816DE5e0E428ac771d77B5 (artifacts/root_cause/data_collector/iter_3/contract/1/0xb02f39e382c90160eb816de5e0e428ac771d77b5/decompile/0xb02f39e382c90160eb816de5e0e428ac771d77b5-decompiled.sol) maintains owner-controlled configuration for settlement, reactor, swapERC20, and limit-order protocol addresses; key functions that interact with Settlement (e.g., selectors 0x869b84e6 and 0xa090949a) require storage_map_a[msg.sender] == 0x01 or msg.sender == owner, meaning only authorized addresses (such as Settlement itself or designated operators) can trigger settlement flows.
  - The USDC token used is FiatTokenV2_2 at 0xA0b86991C6218B36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606EB48 with known storage layout (artifacts/root_cause/data_collector/iter_3/tx/1/0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6/usdc_state_and_balance_diff.json), where totalSupply resides at slot 11 and balances are mapped from holders at slot 9.

## Vulnerability & Root Cause Analysis

**Vulnerability brief**

No vulnerability was identified: the Settlement, router, and resolver contracts enforce access controls (whitelists and hardcoded sender/origin checks), USDC totalSupply remains constant, and all token flows in the seed tx conserve value and match expected 1inch settlement semantics.

**Root cause detail**

A detailed review of Settlement.sol shows that all settlement flows are initiated either via external settleOrders calls or via fillOrderInteraction called from IOrderMixin, with the core _settleOrder function performing a resolver whitelist check (order.checkResolver(resolver)), computing total fees (FeeBankCharger and salt-based fees), appending a structured suffix containing resolver, taker asset, rate bump, fee data, and tokens/amounts, and then calling IOrderMixin.fillOrderTo. The decompiled resolver 0xB02F39... reveals that calls into Settlement (selector 0x869b84e6) are gated by storage_map_a[msg.sender] == 0x01 and that configuration setters (setSettlement, setReactor, setLimitOrderProtocol, setWNative, setSwapERC20, etc.) all require msg.sender == owner, limiting operational control to the resolver operator. The router 0x019bfc71... hardcodes both tx.origin and msg.sender to a single EOA 0xa7264a43..., making it impossible for an unprivileged adversary to invoke the router’s settle function without that private key. The reconciled USDC state diff confirms that totalSupply_before == totalSupply_after and that holder deltas sum to zero across 0xB02F39... (-2,000,000,000,000), 0xA88800... (+999,999,999,985), 0x019bfc71... (+15), and 0xBbb587... (+1,000,000,000,000), matching the Transfer logs and leaving no unexplained sink or source of USDC. Together with the ETH balance diff (gas paid by 0xa7264a43..., fee received by 0x4838...), these facts show that the transaction is simply a user 0xa7264a43... using a private router to instruct 1inch Settlement, via whitelisted resolver 0xB02F39..., to spend resolver USDC to fill order(s) paying 1,000,000 USDC to beneficiary 0xBbb587... and accruing protocol fees to Settlement, with no deviation from intended design.

## Adversary Flow Analysis

**Adversary strategy summary**

No adversary-controlled strategy is evident: the only EOA originating the seed tx (0xa7264a43...) loses ETH to gas, the resolver contract 0xB02F39... loses USDC as part of expected order settlement, and all positive balance changes accrue to protocol/infrastructure addresses (Settlement, miner/builder) or to the explicitly designated USDC recipient 0xBbb587..., without any evidence that these addresses belong to an unprivileged attacker cluster.

### Adversary-Related Accounts

- Adversary cluster addresses: none (no qualifying attacker cluster identified).
- Victim candidates:
  - User router and controlling EOA (custom smart account) (Ethereum chainid 1 at 0x019bfc71d43c3492926d4a9a6c781f36706970c9): Decompiled router code proves that settle(bytes orders) and EIP-1271-like signature verification are restricted to tx.origin/msg.sender == 0xa7264a43..., so this contract is effectively a per-user smart account controlled by EOA 0xa7264a43...
  - Controlling EOA for router (Ethereum chainid 1 at 0xa7264a43a57ca17012148c46adbc15a5f951766e): Seed tx sender and hardcoded origin/sender in router decompilation; pays gas and does not receive USDC or ETH in this transaction.
  - 1inch Settlement contract (Ethereum chainid 1 at 0xA88800CD213dA5Ae406ce248380802BD53b47647): Verified Settlement contract that orchestrates limit-order fills and fee-bank charging; receives USDC consistent with protocol fees in this tx.
  - Resolver / solver contract (Ethereum chainid 1 at 0xB02F39e382c90160Eb816DE5e0E428ac771d77B5): Decompiled contract used as resolver/solver by Settlement; loses 2,000,000 USDC in the seed tx and is owner/whitelist-controlled, not permissionless.
  - USDC beneficiary EOA (Ethereum chainid 1 at 0xBbb587E59251D219a7a05Ce989ec1969C01522C0): Receives 1,000,000 USDC in the seed tx; later transactions show ordinary EOA behavior and ETH transfers from 0xa7264a43..., but there is no evidence tying it to an attacker-controlled solver or exploit contract.

### Lifecycle Stages

**Stage: User initiates settlement via custom router**
- Tx 0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6 on chain Ethereum (chainid 1), block 21982111, mechanism settle(bytes orders) routed to Settlement.

Effect:

  EOA 0xa7264a43... calls router 0x019bfc71... with selector 0xd0322fbf (settle), which forwards the call to Settlement 0xA88800... using pre-encoded order data that references resolver 0xB02F39..., USDC, USDT, and WETH.

**Stage: Settlement interacts with resolver and tokens**
- Tx 0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6 on chain Ethereum (chainid 1), block 21982111.

Effect:

  Settlement 0xA88800... verifies the resolver via order.checkResolver, computes fees, and calls its configured resolver 0xB02F39..., which in turn sources USDC and orchestrates transfers via USDC (FiatTokenV2_2), USDT, and WETH to fulfill the encoded orders.

**Stage: Final token and fee settlement**
- Tx 0x62734ce80311e64630a009dd101a967ea0a9c012fabbfce8eac90f0f4ca090d6 on chain Ethereum (chainid 1), block 21982111.

Effect:

  Per the reconciled USDC state diff, 0xB02F39... loses 2,000,000 USDC, Settlement 0xA88800... gains ~1,000,000 USDC (fee bank and intermediate accounting), router 0x019bfc71... gains 15 USDC, and beneficiary 0xBbb587... receives 1,000,000 USDC; ETH balances change only for the sender (gas cost) and fee recipient 0x4838....

## Impact & Losses

### Token-Level Impact
- USDC: 0 total loss attributable to adversary.

### Impact Narrative

There is no protocol loss attributable to an adversary. The resolver/solver contract 0xB02F39... spends 2,000,000 USDC, while Settlement and the designated USDC recipient gain USDC balances in a way that conserves totalSupply and matches expected 1inch settlement behavior. The only ETH loss is the normal gas cost paid by 0xa7264a43..., and the only ETH gain is the miner/builder fee to 0x4838..., which is part of standard transaction inclusion economics.
